# Are you ready for some sport stats?

Pick one of the following sports, football, hockey, or basketball, and create a program that calculates one of the following statistics. Your program will have two classes. The main class (BOSS) will ask the user to enter all the important information needed to determine the statistic, and the worker class (SERVER) will take that information and calculate the sport statistic you picked. (Google is your friend to determine the formula!)

Football: Calculate the team’s winning percentage.

Hockey: Calculate S% (percentage of shots that end up scoring a goal)

Basketball: Calculate a player's three point percentage.

The main class will have:
```
• The main method

• A worker object

• Will ask for all needed information and pass it as parameters to the worker object.

• Display the statistic, passed back from the server class.
```
The worker class will have:
```
• A constructor method

• Private variables needed to accomplish the task

• All the private variables will be instantiated inside the constructor

• Will have at least 3 methods, including the toString and constructor methods.
```
## Extra Credit:

Create a program that will calculate all three stats, and uses separate methods in the server class to determine each sports required statistic.
